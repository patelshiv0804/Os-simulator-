            The LOOK algorithm is a disk scheduling algorithm that scans the
            disk from the current position of the disk arm to the last request
            in one direction and then moves back to the first request in the
            opposite direction.
          </p>
          <p class="the-look-algorithm1">
            The LOOK algorithm is designed to reduce the seek time by
            minimizing the distance the disk arm has to travel to service a
            request. The algorithm schedules the requests in such a way that
            the disk arm moves continuously in one direction without any
            backtracking, which indirectly improves performance by maximizing
            throughput and reducing the total time required to access and
            retrieve data from the disk.

            LOOK aims to minimize disk arm movement and reduce seek time by
            optimizing the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced. It
            achieves this by scanning the disk in one direction until it
            encounters the last request in that direction, and then reverses
            direction without necessarily reaching the end of the disk. This
            approach helps in reducing the average seek time compared to
            simpler algorithms like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).
