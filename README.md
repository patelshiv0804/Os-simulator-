# Os-simulator-

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project is an Operating System Simulator that provides implementations of key scheduling and memory management algorithms. The simulator helps in understanding the working of different algorithms by visualizing their execution and performance.

<h3>Landing Page</h3>
The OS Simulator includes a Landing Page with a navigation bar for seamless navigation between different sections of the simulator. The landing page also features an Explore Me button, which allows users to start the simulation and interact with the different scheduling and memory management algorithms.

<h3>Features</h3>

<h4>1. Shortest Job First (SJF)</h4>
Use: The Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm selects the process with the shortest execution time. It minimizes the average waiting time, making it an optimal choice for batch processing systems.

<h4>2. Dining Philosopher Problem</h4>
Use: The Dining Philosopher problem is a classic synchronization problem in operating systems that demonstrates the challenges of avoiding deadlock and starvation in concurrent processes. It is used to study resource allocation strategies.

<h4>3. LOOK / C-LOOK Disk Scheduling</h4>
Use: The LOOK and C-LOOK algorithms are advanced disk scheduling techniques used to optimize the movement of the disk arm. LOOK stops at the last request before reversing direction, while C-LOOK directly moves to the farthest request before reversing, reducing unnecessary head movement.

<h4>4. FIFO Page Replacement</h4>
Use: The First-In-First-Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm manages memory by replacing the oldest page when a new page is needed. It is a simple and easy-to-implement page replacement policy.
