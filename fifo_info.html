      <div class="page-replacement-is">
        Page replacement is used to manage the limited physical memory
        resources efficiently. In systems with virtual memory, not all pages
        of a process need to be in memory at once. When the system encounters
        a page fault, it needs to decide which page to replace in order to
        bring in the required page from secondary storage. This decision is
        based on various page replacement algorithms.

              FIFO which is also known as First In First Out is one of the
              types of page replacement algorithm. The FIFO algorithm is used
              in the paging method for memory management in an operating
              system that decides which existing page needs to be replaced in
              the queue.

                Maintaining a List of Pages: The operating system keeps track
                of all pages currently residing in the memory. This list
                essentially serves as a queue, with the oldest pages at the
                front (head) of the queue and the newest at the back (tail).

              <li class="bringing-in-a">
                Bringing in a New Page: When a new page needs to be loaded
                into memory from the secondary storage (such as the hard
                disk), the operating system checks if there is space available
                in the physical memory. If there is available space, the new
                page is loaded into memory. However, if the memory is already
                full, a page replacement decision needs to be made.

                Handling Page Fault: In case of a page fault (when the
                requested page is not found in memory), the operating system
                selects a page to evict from the memory to make room for the
                incoming page. In FIFO, the decision is straightforward: the
                oldest page in memory, which is at the head of the list, is
                selected for replacement.
              </li>

                Removing the Oldest Page: The page at the head of the list,
                which is the oldest page in memory, is removed to make space
                for the new page. This removal is performed regardless of the
                importance or frequency of use of the evicted page.
              </li>
              <li class="adding-the-new">
                Adding the New Page: Once the oldest page is removed, the new
                page is added to the memory and placed at the tail of the
                list, signifying it as the newest addition to the memory.

                The FIFO algorithm operates on a simple principle: the page
                that has been in memory the longest is the first to be
                replaced when a new page needs to be brought in.
